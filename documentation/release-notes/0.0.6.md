# Release 0.0.6
- fix for [issue #5](https://bitbucket.org/jatone/genieql/issues/5)
- seperated out interfaces to allow for usage of both static and dynamic scanners
simultaneously.
- genieql generate insert now ignores columns that the mapping doesn't know about.
- added a bunch of experimental commands for generating functions.
- basic support for sqlite3.
- support for the pgx postgresql driver.
- behaviour of original map/generate/query commands has changed with regards to how alias worked.
  it now is based off the column name instead of the struct field.
